Spring Boot Restful API Project


This project is my first Spring Boot project where I have developed a Restful API with all the necessary features and proper validation. The API allows users to perform various operations and interact with the underlying data.




## Features

- CRUD operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete data through the API endpoints.
- Proper Validation: The API includes validation mechanisms to ensure the data integrity and consistency.
- RESTful Architecture: The project follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) for designing the API.
- Documentation: The API endpoints and their functionalities are well-documented for easy understanding and usage.
- Security: The project includes security measures such as authentication and authorization to protect the API resources.
- Error Handling: Appropriate error handling mechanisms are implemented to provide meaningful error messages to the API users.


## Deployment

To get started with the project, follow these steps:
```bash
1. Clone the repository: git clone : https://github.com/chandankeshri1812/spring_boot_P1_.git
```

```bash
2. Install the necessary dependencies: mvn install
```
```bash
3. Configure the project: Update the configuration files with the required settings.
```
```bash
4. Run the application: mvn spring-boot:run
```
```bash
5. Access the API endpoints: Use a REST client application to interact with the API. 
```
## Documentation
